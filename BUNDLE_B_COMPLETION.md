- Evaluates war weariness for both parties
- Peace triggers: decisive victory (>70% margin) OR high weariness (>50%)
- Generates graduated peace terms based on victory margin:
  - **Decisive (>70%):** Harsh terms (50 prestige loss, 1000 tribute, 2 provinces)
  - **Clear (>40%):** Moderate terms (30 prestige loss, 500 tribute, 1 province)
  - **Close (<40%):** White peace (10 prestige loss, status quo)
- Calls SueForPeace() with calculated terms
- Applies prestige/reputation changes to victor and loser

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic peace term generation
- War weariness influence
- Prestige and reputation effects
- Graduated term severity

## 🔧 Component Architecture Changes

### DiplomacyComponent Updates
**File:** `include/game/diplomacy/DiplomacyComponents.h`

**Added Fields:**
```cpp
std::vector<DynasticMarriage> marriages;  // Track royal marriages
double war_weariness = 0.0;               // War fatigue (0.0-1.0)
```

**Added Method:**
```cpp
void BreakTreaty(types::EntityID other_realm, TreatyType type);
```

### DiplomacyComponents Implementation
**File:** `src/game/diplomacy/DiplomacyComponents.cpp`

**New Method Implementation:**
```cpp
void DiplomacyComponent::BreakTreaty(types::EntityID other_realm, TreatyType type) {
    // Marks matching treaties as inactive
    // Iterates through active_treaties and sets is_active = false
}
```
