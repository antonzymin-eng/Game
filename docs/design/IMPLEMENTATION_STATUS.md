## Statistics Summary

**Overall Progress:**
- ✅ **Implemented:** ~35% of core features
- ðŸŸ¨ **Partial:** ~40% of core features
- ⚠️ **Planned:** ~15% of core features
- ❌ **Not Started:** ~10% of core features

**By System:**
| System | Core Complete | Extensions Complete |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Engine & Runtime | 90% | 0% |
| Geography & World | 50% | 0% |
| Population & Society | 70% | 0% |
| Mesh Systems | 30% | 0% |
| Military | 60% | 0% |
| Naval | 40% | 0% |
| Espionage & Intrigue | 0% | 0% |
| Council & Politics | 50% | 0% |
| Events & History | 20% | 0% |
| Technology | 70% | 0% |
| Economy & Trade | 80% | 0% |
| AI Behavior | 90% | 10% |

**Key Insight:** Core systems are well-developed (60-70% average), but planned extensions are largely untouched (0-10%). The **LOD 4 terrain grid** is the highest priority missing feature from the original design vision.
