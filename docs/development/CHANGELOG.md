- **TODO Reduction**: 41 â†’ 28 TODOs (-13 completed tasks)
- **Build Status**: âœ… Clean compilation maintained (9.6MB executable)

### Added - DiplomacySystem Core Features

  - `EstablishEmbassy()`: Creates diplomatic relationships, +10 opinion, +5% trust
  - `RecallAmbassador()`: Applies -15 opinion penalty, -10% trust, tracks incidents
  - `SendDiplomaticGift()`: Dynamic opinion bonus (5-30 based on gift value), +2% trust

- **Treaty System** (4 methods):
  - `ProposeTradeAgreement()`: Creates Treaty objects using helper methods, +5 opinion
  - `ProcessTreatyCompliance()`: Checks treaty conditions, applies compliance decay (1%/update)
  - `UpdateTreatyStatus()`: Handles treaty expiration and broken treaty detection
  - `HandleTreatyViolation()`: Applies -30 opinion penalty, -30% trust, reputation hit

- **Helper Calculation Methods** (7 methods):
  - `CalculateBaseOpinion()`: Comprehensive opinion calculation (reputation, treaties, trust, incidents)

- Updated `diplomacy_tasks.md`: Task tracking and bundle organization
- Created `claude_prompt_template.md`: Ready-to-use prompts for remaining bundles

### Next Steps
